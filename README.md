## Algorithm:

### Player Controller
### Step 1: Extract the package and in unity , asserts -> Import packages -> Custom packages and select the package. When we go to Assets folders we can see the course library which we extracted
### Step 2: If you want, drag a different material from Course Library > Materials onto the Ground object
### Step 3: Drag 1 Human, 3 Animals, and 1 Food object into the Hierarchy
### Step 4: Rename the character “Player”, then reposition the animals and food so you can see them
### Step 5: Adjust the XYZ scale of the food (2,2,2) so you can easily see it from above
### Step 6: In your Assets folder, create a “Scripts” folder, and a “PlayerController” script inside.Attach the script to the Player by dragging the c# file to the player and open in the inspector and check whether it is attached

### Flood Flight
### Step 1: Create a new “MoveForward” script, attach script to the Food Pizza by dragging the c# file to the pizza and open in the inspector and check whether it is attached
### Step 2: Create a new “Prefabs” folder, drag your food (Pizza) into Prefab folder, and a pop up raises-> choose Original Prefab
### Step 3: Select the Player in the hierarchy, then drag the pizza from your Prefabs folder onto the new Projectile Prefab box in the inspector
### Step 4: Rotate all animals on the Y axis by 180 degrees to face down
### Step 5: Select all three animals in the hierarchy and Add Component > Drag the Move Forward script from the Scripts into inspector
### Step 6: Edit their speed values and test to see how it looks. Drag all three animals into the Prefabs folder, choosing “Original Prefab”
